Importance of Testing:
1. Ensures Quality: Testing helps ensure the product or system meets the required standards and quality expectations.
2. Identifies Defects: Testing identifies defects, bugs, and errors, allowing for fixes before release.
3. Prevents Failures: Testing helps prevent failures, reducing the risk of costly repairs or even safety hazards.
4. Improves Reliability: Testing ensures the product or system is reliable and functions as intended.
5. Enhances User Experience: Testing helps ensure the product or system is user-friendly and meets user needs.
6. Reduces Costs: Testing reduces costs by identifying and fixing issues early, preventing costly rework or repairs.
7. Increases Confidence: Testing gives stakeholders confidence in the product or system, ensuring it meets requirements and works as expected.
 Example1: Medical Devices
Imagine a new pacemaker is developed to save lives. Without thorough testing, it might have a faulty battery or incorrect programming. 
-If not detected, it could lead to serious harm or even death. Testing ensures the pacemaker works correctly and safely.

Example 2: Software Applications
A bank develops a new mobile app for online transactions. Without testing, the app might have security vulnerabilities or bugs that allow hackers to access customers' accounts. 
Testing helps identify and fix these issues, protecting customers' sensitive information.

Example 3: Aerospace Engineering
A new aircraft is designed with advanced navigation systems. Without rigorous testing, the system might fail during flight, putting passengers' lives at risk. 
Testing ensures the system works flawlessly and meets safety standards.
